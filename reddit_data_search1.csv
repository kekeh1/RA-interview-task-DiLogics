How to automate casting a web player to smart TV?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/vbksyu/how_to_automate_casting_a_web_player_to_smart_tv/,"Hi, my grandmother would really like to view a religious TV channel that is broadcasted on the internet live for free.She has a smart TV and smart phone with android. I've set the phone up for her as easy as I can, but it is still very difficult for her to use it. I've basically locked the phone down to only sms, phone, camera, etc. with nova launcher.For now, I have made an app shortcut on her home screen that takes her directly to the web player, but she needs to press play herself, which she can, but doing the casting process is to difficult.Was wondering if there is a way to make it all automatic when she presses that app shortcut?Thanks!",[]

"Non-web designer, seeking to understand how to interact with webpages using automation",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnwebdesign/comments/qqvi7h/nonweb_designer_seeking_to_understand_how_to/,"Hello,I'm a non-web designer, but I work in IT and have some background in scripting and automation.  Specifically, I'm interested in being able to create automation routines that simulate the loading of websites and interacting with web page forms, text fields, simulating entering text, even clicking web-page buttons.In the current situation, I'm using Microsoft Power Automate Desktop, which includes some web automation functionality among other features.I'm using Google Chrome and just for the fun of it, I've decided to choose a website I found today that lets users easily create a little poster containing the home's wi-fi details for visitors.The webpage URL is:  https://www.bronion.co/frame-your-wifiSo far, my automation can successfully visit the page and switch between each for the form controls I want and enter the text I want in them.  Once I've filled the form the way I want, I want the automation to then 'hit' the button at the bottom of the webpage, marked 'Download Your Design'.It is here that my automation is seeming to fail.Now, before to dig into exactly why it is failing, I was curious.  Looking at the actual HTML around that button, I see this:<button class=""btn btn-warning"">Download Your Design</button>Okay, that tells me the button class and it's current contents, but I don't know anything about web design beyond this.  Is the actual script/code being triggered by the button press entirely hidden from users?Is there a means by which my automation could call or visit the URL of the code that is executed by the button press instead of trying to press the button itself?I used Google Chrome's Developer Mode (F12, or right-click on page elements and choose Inspect) and went to the 'Sources' tab and explored the contents of the page until I found what could be the code that is the guts of it, that actually takes the values entered and produces a PNG file, a script here:https://www.bronion.co/static/js/pages/Wifi/Wifi.jsUnfortunately, I don't know JavaScript, or at least how to just 'call' it in the context of the webpage.Should I continue trying to click the button or should I be able to call code myself?","['Your button is missing an action - look up ""onclick"" and you\'ll get the idea. Generally though you\'d use JavaScript to select your button and add the onclick once the page is loaded (document.getelementbyid or even document.queryselector to select it).If you\'re doing automated website testing (like it sounds you\'re doing), I\'d recommend you look at Selenium. You need the specific driver for whatever browser you have (it\'s easy to get), and you can then script it using python. I use it a lot, there are loads of tutorials too and it\'s pretty straight forward.Edit: go into your browser console, and just start typing JavaScript there - first select your element, then add the onclick to it, and just tell it to console.log some text when you click it. It\'s easy.']"

How to have an automated train just sit at a station?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/z1nhbc/how_to_have_an_automated_train_just_sit_at_a/,"I recently learned I can change the schedule of any train from any station and got the bright idea to leave a train docked at a station stocked with building supplies i can call from anywhere to get materials to build a new factory.

When parking your train, set the waiting station as the only destination, wait for it to park, and then disable autopilot.

How to switch from Industrial Automation to Tech?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xkdp9l/how_to_switch_from_industrial_automation_to_tech/,"I'm an engineer who has done many different jobs but I'm interested in switching from heavy industry into something more programming focused. I'm open to any and all ideas!My BackgroundBS and MS in Mechanical Engineering. I have a total of 5 years experience as an engineer. I've worked in many different jobs, but most of them are more electrical than mechanical. In college I wrote a lot of MATLAB code for advanced mathematics and data analysis.My most recent 2.5 years of experience (across 3 different jobs) have been doing Industrial Automation, also known as Controls. This is a combination of mechanical, electrical, and programming. The programming languages are industry-specific (Siemens, Rockwell), and they look very different than text-based programming. The programs I write are usually a huge series of IF statements that collect sensor data and control things like valve position, motor speed, graphics display, etc.The job I'm at now is still Controls, but they program in two text based languages. One of them is a C++ derivative, the other is very similar to it. I'm working on a project now with many thousands of lines of code that controls 70 conveyors and 3 robotic cranes. I've also used Python to automate the creation of some of my code in other languages.I know how to program, I just don't have the languages, education, or experience that most of the tech job posts ask for.Controls also has a lot to do with IT / Networking stuff. So I'm also very familiar with some aspects of network design and troubleshooting.What I'm looking forThe main things I'm looking for are 1) remote work, or at least hybrid, 2) Not as much travel to job sites, 3) Better pay (the most I can probably expect to make as a controls engineer is 120k).It seems like tech or some sort of software role would be a great step in the right direction, but I'm open minded.My QuestionsIs tech the right move for me? Are there some other options I'm not considering?Is my experience enough to get a programming job? If so, what type of jobs should I look for?What's the best way for me to find a job that would be a good fit? I think I'm an atypical candidate.If my experience is not enough, what am I missing?

Being asked to learn automation testing for web front end at my job,https://www.reddit.com/r/QualityAssurance/comments/oqpl6u/being_asked_to_learn_automation_testing_for_web/,"Hi everyone, I’ve been in my role now doing manual and usability testing for a couple years and recently I’ve been told by management that I have to learn automation of our frontend website using selenium. I would not consider myself as a developer so coding experience I have very little of but I’ve looked into selenium and it seems quite complex. Would this be something that I would be able to learn by doing online courses and how long would you expect someone to learn? I’m just not sure if this is something I could realistically learn anytime soon. Any guidance for from experienced tester would be appreciated. Cheers","[""couple suggestions. might not be viable for you, but look into cypress.io. it's not selenium based but if you're doing front end automation for a JavaScript app it's really great, and it's an all-in-one environment so it's not as complicated as building your own selenium environment.other suggestion would be look into a program called Katalon. it is selenium based but it's an all-in-one IDE, and makes it fairly easy to both build java, code based, automation test cases, as well as codeless test cases using manual operations that get automatically translated into automation code.my company has been in the middle of moving from manual to automation and we chose to use Katalon. it's been a mostly positive experience and fairly quick/easy to get things going from zero."", 'Thanks that’s very helpful!', ""You'd need to acquire basic coding skills in the language of your choice and to learn about the different patterns used to write automated tests.Being able to learn on your own is very important in software engineering, because there is always something new and shiny. I'd say start with learning the language and once you're comfortable enough with your dev environment, how to handle git, your IDE, how to run your code and debug it, then look into the automation tools.Why Selenium though? While it's the only official standard, there are much more modern tools like TestCafe, Cypress, Playwright and so on. If you lean JavaScript/TypeScript you'd kill two birds with one stone, not only you'd be able to automate with that language, but you'll also be able to understand the logic of the webpage."", 'It’s it’s just what I was told was to use selenium by management. Interesting to know there are other alternatives. Thanks.', 'I think what you found complex is the whole jargon that’s involved in a language. I would suggest following a youtube tutorial on setting up Selenium for beginners and using it automation. Your organisation is doing you a favour by making you learn automation. Surviving on just Manual testing is very hard these days.', ""Just make sure you're getting paid like automation testers or SDTEs or it's a scam and you should run for the exit."", 'I get where you are coming from but on the other hand if I’m being paid to learn it I could just move to another job with the new found skills if I’m not getting paid more afterwards.', ""First of all, you're going to just need to work on your coding, no way around that.  There are some solid online classes for that (I like Rice University's Intro to Python set of classes, found on Coursera).Then, you're going to need to know a lot about locators.  How to make them right, basically.  A locator is how selenium (or cypress) finds the element on the page.  But there's a few basic rules to doing it right."", ""Some comments here about low code solutions. I would just suggest to buckle up and start to learning to code. Find some free sites online to get you at least through object oriented programming. If using C#, learning collections and Linq will be very useful as well. Then look up Page Object Model and you're pretty much set (after getting used to pros/cons of different locators). It sounds like a lot, but I doubt they expect you to be proficient by tomorrow anyways, I'd say in about a month you would be productive (and much more valuable)."", 'Thanks for the feedback.', ""The other answers here are doing you a disservice by just naming a bunch of automation tools. If your workplace uses Selenium and is asking you to learn it then there's no need to get distracted by any of the countless other testing tools.Make sure you have a basic grasp of classes and objects, then find a tutorial series on Youtube for whatever programming language your employer is using. You don't need to follow very far, just enough to get an idea of what the language looks like and how to perform simple tasks. Make sure it goes through the setup and installation process so you can follow along. Then when you're comfortable, switch to a Selenium specific tutorial for the language and follow along with that instead. If you're not pressed for time you could be making simple tests within a week.Keep in mind you can practice on any website, so try to come up with ideas for websites you actually visit. Search Reddit for something, send yourself an email, automate a simple browser game, etc."", 'Thanks that’s great.

This is a learning experience and on-the-job training always works out better than if you were to try to learn this stuff on your own time and own dime.

Web client UI automation tools,https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaretesting/comments/u8kvx9/web_client_ui_automation_tools/,"I'm starting a new role in about 6 weeks as QA Automation Lead. The company is a startup with a fledgling product that has a web client front end. They want me to introduce automated testing from scratch and for it to integrate with their build and CI/CD process. I don't have much more than that to go on at the moment but am starting to think about tooling options ahead of time.In my current role I've used Selenium to do web client automation, so I'm interested to hear what other automation tools people have used for web client testing and what the pros and cons have been in your personal experience. Any examples of integration with CI/CD to run smoke or regression suites would also be really useful to hear about.TIA!","['The place I\'m currently work is, for the most part, a ""java shop"". All back end code is in Java. I joined this company not quite a year ago, and I am a major proponent of utilizing tools that fit the requirements, but also ones that rely upon skills we already support. So, while I am most proficient with .NET, I wanted to use something that the company was more interested in supporting, since the language really doesn\'t matter to me. So,  looked into tools that used languages that we already were using, and that had the features we would need. My primary contenders was Cypress.IO or Java with Selenide. When talking with the tech leads who would be supporting my testers, I asked them whether they would rather need to help with Java or JavaScript.Hands down, Java was the answer. In the end, I think this was the better choice for our requirements. We have some API testing that we\'re also integrating with the tests, with RestAssured, which Cypress could have handled. What it could not handle is that we have some requirements for testing that requires multiple web domains. It\'s very contrary to how I would prefer to test, but a couple of our products relies upon that, and I can\'t talk the business folks out of the requirement, nor the development folks into helping with test harnesses that would allow it.Before considering any tool, I highly recommend ensuring you know what your current tech stack is, on a per project basis, as well as what your testing needs are going to require, before making a decision on what to move forward with. Personally, I would now choose Selenide over any Selenium solution, to the point of increasing the tech stack with a ""new"" language, because of how much better it is to work with.', ""The devs are using TypeScript so for the same reasons you've mentioned that's probably what I'll use too. I used C# for Selenium which I've heard is not too hard to migrate from in terms of learning a new language. I'll add Cypress.io to my research list 👍🏻"", ""Another vote for cypress.io!Easy to use. Documentation is great. Typescript support. The Cypress community is big already and growing even bigger so lots of support to be found.They have a paid service (Cypress dashboard) that gives nice reporting and allows for running tests in parallel. If you don't want to pay there is a module out there called 'sorry-cypress' that you can setup yourself and use to get many of the same features"", 'Sounds good, thanks!', ""I've only used Java Selenium.

A LinkedIn invitation is significantly more reachable than an email or a cold call.Users can build customized messages with stand-ins for up to 100 new invitations to be issued immediately using the LinkedIn automation application Linkedcamp. It also allows you to schedule follow-up messages, which eliminates the need to manually process follow-ups with much more than 100 contacts — which is time-consuming if they don’t respond.Users can focus on connecting with customers and building relationships. Linkedcamp prevents being “spammy” because of its personalized approach, which boosts the possibility of attracting qualified leads.","[""If this post doesn't follow the rules report it to the mods.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How long should it take to learn flask decently? I feel I am going to slow it been a few months over a year. I also added pytesting to my code. Is that embarrassingly slow.

Strictly speaking, Flask itself is quite limited in scope. It is a small component in a very large web of technologies, concepts, and skills that make up web development. When people say they\'re struggling to ""learn Flask"", it\'s often true that they\'re actually struggling with Python, or Jinja, or CSS, or programming paradigms, or reasoning about how HTTP request-response works, or database design, or an ORM, and so on and so on. If you\'re starting from light programming knowledge, and no web development knowledge, you have to first become familiar with all the myriad things that allow you to work with Flask, not just Flask.And that\'s not even getting into the context of how you\'re using Flask, i.e. what you\'re specifically trying to build. I\'ve used Flask professionally every day for years, but there are plenty of categories of webdev problems to solve that I\'ve never dealt with, because they\'ve never come up for me. Every new project has some challenge — some new thing to figure out — and always a few missteps. It\'s important to remember that programming isn\'t about the tools, it\'s about problem-solving; so realistically there\'s no point at which you\'re ""done learning"" XYZ and it\'s smooth sailing from then on.So all that said, I think your question more accurately boils down to ""how long does it take to become reasonably proficient in web development?"". And a year or more is not unreasonable at all if you\'re starting from minimal knowledge. But it\'s impossible to say how long it should take, because it entirely depends on what you\'re trying to do (now, and in the future) and where you\'re starting from.']"

Without being a coder/programmer, you can\'t really test any other way cheaply. The ""experiment"" part is what requires programming knowledge here, so I think your best bet is to approximate what you want to do as best you can manually.I\'m not sure if that was helpful, but it sounds like maybe you already have an intake form for potential customers and their info, so you may have to either tell them you\'ll get their sample report in 24hrs and email it to them, which you\'d probably want to do for free for now to test the market; or find some other means which gives them an incentive to provide info but wait to get the results instead of expecting them instantly.']"

LinkedIn automation tools can save you a lot of time. You don’t want to waste any of the 8 to 10 hours of a workday on a potentially unsuccessful new venture.Establishing and using LinkedIn automation tools takes only a few minutes per day. The case that individuals use LinkedIn to connect with others distinguishes it. They’ve already got entry. A LinkedIn invitation is significantly more reachable than an email or a cold call.Users can build customized messages with stand-ins for up to 100 new invitations to be issued immediately using the LinkedIn automation application Linkedcamp. It also allows you to schedule follow-up messages, which eliminates the need to manually process follow-ups with much more than 100 contacts — which is time-consuming if they don’t respond.Users can focus on connecting with customers and building relationships. Linkedcamp prevents being “spammy” because of its personalized approach, which boosts the possibility of attracting qualified leads.","[""If this post doesn't follow the rules report it to the mods.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Strictly speaking, Flask itself is quite limited in scope. It is a small component in a very large web of technologies, concepts, and skills that make up web development.

If you\'re starting from light programming knowledge, and no web development knowledge, you have to first become familiar with all the myriad things that allow you to work with Flask, not just Flask.And that\'s not even getting into the context of how you\'re using Flask, i.e. what you\'re specifically trying to build. I\'ve used Flask professionally every day for years, but there are plenty of categories of webdev problems to solve that I\'ve never dealt with, because they\'ve never come up for me. Every new project has some challenge — some new thing to figure out — and always a few missteps. It\'s important to remember that programming isn\'t about the tools, it\'s about problem-solving; so realistically there\'s no point at which you\'re ""done learning"" XYZ and it\'s smooth sailing from then on.So all that said, I think your question more accurately boils down to ""how long does it take to become reasonably proficient in web development?"". And a year or more is not unreasonable at all if you\'re starting from minimal knowledge. But it\'s impossible to say how long it should take, because it entirely depends on what you\'re trying to do (now, and in the future) and where you\'re starting from.']"

How to Grow Your Business with Email Marketing Automation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emailmarketing/comments/vj22so/how_to_grow_your_business_with_email_marketing/,"Email marketing automation can be a gamechanger for small businesses. It allows you to stay in touch with your customers and prospects, without having to put in a lot of extra work. And, it can help you grow your business by making it easier to convert leads into customers and customers into repeat buyers.But, email marketing automation is not a magic bullet. It takes planning and effort to make it work. Allow me to give you some tips on how to use email marketing automation to grow your small business.1. Use Lead Scoring to Prioritize Your LeadsIf you're not familiar with lead scoring, it's a method of rating your leads based on their likelihood of becoming customers. The higher the score, the more likely it is that the lead will buy from you.Lead scoring is important because it allows you to prioritize your leads. You can't sell to all of your leads, so you need to focus on the ones that are most likely to buy.To create a lead scoring system, you first need to identify the factors that indicate a high-quality lead. These will be different for every business, but some common indicators include:Demographic information (e.g., job title, company size, etc.)Website behavior (e.g., pages visited, time on site, etc.)Engagement with your brand (e.g., downloads, email opens, etc.)Once you've identified the indicators of a high-quality lead, you need to assign a score to each one. The scoring system can be as simple or as complicated as you want, but the important thing is to be consistent.Once you have your lead scoring system in place, you can start to prioritize your leads. The leads with the highest scores should be your top priority.2. Set Up Lead Nurturing CampaignsLead nurturing is the process of building relationships with your leads until they're ready to buy. It's important because it keeps your leads warm, even if they're not ready to buy right now.Lead nurturing campaigns are typically a series of emails, each of which is designed to move the lead closer to a purchase. For example, you might start with an email that introduces your company and its products. The next email might provide more information about a specific product. And, the final email might include a special offer or discount.Lead nurturing campaigns can be very effective, but they take time to set up. You need to create a series of emails, and then you need to set up a system to send them out automatically. The good news is, that there are many software programs that can help with this.3. Use Email SegmentationEmail segmentation is the process of dividing your email list into smaller groups, based on common characteristics. For example, you might segment your list by:GeographyDemographicsPurchase historyEngagement with your brandEmail segmentation is important because it allows you to send more targeted emails. When you segment your list, you can send emails that are more relevant to each group. This makes it more likely that the recipient will read and respond to the email.4. Automate Your Email MarketingOnce you've segmented your list and created lead nurturing campaigns, you're ready to start automating your email marketing. Automation is important because it allows you to stay in touch with your leads without spending a lot of time on email marketing.There are many different ways to automate your email marketing. The most common is to use an email autoresponder, which is a software program that automatically sends emails to your contacts.Email autoresponders are very effective, but they're not the only way to automate your email marketing. You can also use marketing automation softwares like Infusionsoft, Hubspot, Mailchimp, Owl Reply, and many more; it helps you automate your entire email marketing process from start to finish.5. Test, Test, Test!The only way to know what works for your business is to test different things and see what happens. There is no magic formula to success. Email marketing is no different. You need to experiment with different strategies and tactics to see what works best for your business.Some things you might want to test include which provides more features and options.What's the best way to segment your list?What's the best day and time to send your emails?What's the best subject line for your emails?What type of content gets the most engagement from your subscribers?The only way to know the answers to these questions is to test different things and see what works best for your business.6. Measure Your ResultsOnce you've implemented these tips, it's important to measure your results. Email marketing can be very effective, but it's important to track your progress so that you can continue to improve your results.Some of the things you might want to measure include:The number of new subscribers you're getting each monthThe open rate and click-through rate for your emailsThe number of leads you're generating each monthThe number of sales you're making each monthBy tracking your results, you can see what's working and what's not. This will allow you to make adjustments to your strategy so that you can continue to improve your results.So, there you have it. These are just a few tips to help you improve your email marketing results. If you implement these tips, you'll be well on your way to generating more leads and sales from your email list.",[]
