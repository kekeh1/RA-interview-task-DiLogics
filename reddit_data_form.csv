How to get rid of the data in an auto-completed form field,https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsHelp/comments/u2zxrz/how_to_get_rid_of_the_data_in_an_autocompleted/,"Hi,It looks to me that my Windows 10 machine is storing a form field of one of the sites I'm using for work (an MDM site). It is one of the filter-options on a user-page so everytime I use this page, there are 0 results because of this filter value (it is a dummy mail address ""TestiPad10@mydomain.com"" ).Deleting the cookie, browser history and stored form values of all my browsers (using the settings options in the browser itself, under ""Privacy""), resetting browsers back to default and using button ""Empty auto complete list"" in Outlook (suggested to me by our helpdesk) does not help at all. The (filtering) formfield is still auto-completed so I again receive 0 results.Changing the value of that form field also does not help; the browsers doesn't ask me to update the auto-complete form...Does anyone know where Windows stores this data? At this moment, the form gets auto-completed in Edge, Chrome and in Brave although I am very, very sure that I haven't ever used that auto-completed value ""TestiPad10@mydomain.com"" in p.e. Chrome and Edge (up untill 5 days ago, Chrome also didn't do that auto-complete thing, so I was happily using Chrome untill then...)So my guess is that Windows itself stores this somewhere and all the browser use that spot to grab the data for this formfield.Is my guess correct and if so, where are these form values stored...? Any suggestions how to resolve this?",[]
How to stop auto-complete on Elementor Forms,https://www.reddit.com/r/elementor/comments/s1ad44/how_to_stop_autocomplete_on_elementor_forms/,"This has always been an issue, especially with date-pickers but I have found a solution and wanted to share.Give the form a unique class name such as ""auto-complete-off""Add a HTML block on the same page with the following code.<script> jQuery("".auto-complete-off input"").focus(function(){ jQuery(this).attr('autocomplete', 'off'); }); </script>

The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias.” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.” And the Lord said to him, “Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying, and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.” But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.” But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.

That’s the point I’m trying to make here. If a guy comes along and identifies himself as Elvis Presley, you wouldn’t just believe him, and that’s a dude standing before you in the flesh.

He did not see him. Yeshua confronted him about his plans to persecute his followers in Damascus. Paul’s persecution of believers was the one issue that Yeshua had come to address. Paul was not going to be allowed to continue. The fact that Paul didn’t challenge Yeshua to try and stop him, but instead chose to become a believer himself means Paul wasn’t stupid. His conversion was merely a secondary outgrowth of the encounter. Had Paul stubbornly tried to continue, it no doubt would have been the end of him right then and there. In the story of Balaam, it certainly would have been the end of him if he had tried to continue on his way to curse the children of Israel. He was stopped by the angel of the Lord who had a sword in hand and was ready to strike him down. (Numbers 22:22-33) The similarities between Paul and Balaam are striking! It was only after each of them had submitted to the Lord that they got out of danger. Paul asked Yeshua what he wanted him to do, and Yeshua told him to go to Damascus where he would be told what to do. This he did. Later, Yeshua spoke to Ananias in a vision and told him to go to Paul to heal him of the blindness that had occurred to him.

Its good to be open to arguments and viewpoints from many sides. However, you apparently struggle with contextualizing arguments and the nuance of reality.To even oscillate between grandiose economic-ideological concepts like capitalism or socialism based on a redditors’ comment proves you don’t understand either very well. One who understands these concepts don’t just “support” an ideology like this.It is better to think of these concepts as fluid ways of life and every single modern state adopts aspects from both sides. N. Korea relies on capitalistic financing institutions and the US offers comprehensive social welfare which begins by garnishing every single workers’ wage at the paycheck.

Most successful socialist countries use the government as a way for the people to collectively bargain as consumers. That is one important aspect of government. In the US one of our two parties hates the government being used in this way for things like healthcare. As a result, Americans pay more pet capita for insurance and not everyone is covered. That’s an example of a market failure. Another good example is the Tobacco companies misusing science in order to fool smokers into thinking the science about smoking causing illness was not “settled”. Markets are like the power of water.

How to conditionally-display nested forms with multiple children models in parent model edit view?,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/wswj32/how_to_conditionallydisplay_nested_forms_with/,"I have 3 models, nested as follows:The Project model has a project_type attribute, which can be set to schedule, event or list:When project_type is set to schedule, the user can create and associate one or more schedule children records with the project record.When project_type is set to event, the user can create and associate one or more event children records with the project record.When project_type is set to list, the user simply creates a project record, with no schedule or event records associated with it.In the project new view, this works perfectly fine: the user uses radio buttons to determine the value of project_type, and a nested form is displayed accordingly: one schedule form (with a button to add more), one event form (with a button to add more), or no form at all, per the logic introduced above.Here is how I implemented it, using Stimulus:Here is the top of the form:Here is the part of the form that is displayed conditionally for schedules, based on the selection of the user, above:And, here is its equivalent, for events:I use Turbo Frames to allow the user to add more schedule/event forms as necessary, by clicking an ""Add Schedule"" or ""Add Event"" button: I am omitting this part of the code here, as I do not believe it is necessary to solve this issue, but I can include it in an update if relevant.Finally, here is project_type_controller.js:Note*: please bear with me, I am aware the above code needs some serious DRYing up, but I will refactor once I get it working properly.*So, like I said, the above code works perfectly when the form is loaded in the project new view and a new project is created.However, when the form is loaded in the project edit view, i.e. when a user needs to edit an existing project:Then the user is able to access the nested form related to whichever child(ren) schedule/event record(s) is(are) associated with the parent project record, and it's even possible to add more forms, with the corresponding ""Add Schedule"" or ""Add Event"" button.BUT the logic to switch between project_types (schedule, event, list) with radio buttons no longer works: I am not able to display the appropriate nested form when toggling the radio buttons.It seems that the problem is that, whichever nested form was NOT selected upon create — let's the schedule form in the case of an event project —  is simply not included at all in the HTML in the edit view, and therefore it's not possible to set hidden to false to make it appear with the logic implemented in project_type_controller.js, as is possible in the new view (where both the schedule and the event nested forms are served by default).This shows up in the console as the following error:I am hitting a wall, as I have been unable to figure out how to ""force"" include both nested forms in the HTML regardless of the value of project_type, to be able to show or hide them based on how the user toggles the related radio buttons.Is this even a way to accomplish what I need with this approach or have I fallen into anti-pattern territory? If this is a dead end, what would be the best way to implement this business logic?[UPDATE] based on u/cmd-t's comments, I have updated the schedule form like this:And the event form like this:Finally, I have updated the project_type_controller like this:I got the above working in the project new view, and it seems cleaner that what I was running initially (although it still needs to be DRYed up), but I am back to square 1 when it comes to the project edit view:When the user opens the edit view, the right form is presented to them (i.e. the schedule form is the project is a schedule, the event form if the project is an event, and no form if the project is a list).However, as soon as the user changes the type of project by toggling the radio buttons, then we run into the same problem as before, which is that we cannot rend the form for the type of children records that were not saved with the parent project record upon create:If a project was created as a schedule, with one or more schedule children records, then <template data-project-type-target=""event_template""> is rendered as empty in the edit view.If a project was created as an event, with one or more event children records, then <template data-project-type-target=""schedule_template""> is rendered as empty in the edit view.If a project was created as a list, with no schedule or event children records, then both  <template data-project-type-target=""event_template""> and data-project-type-target=""schedule_template""> are rendered as empty in the edit view.In other words: the logic to display the templates is working as expected, but the code inside the templates isn't, which I suppose is happening due to how nested forms work within rails.One avenue I am exploring is to use Turbo Stream to generate and render the appropriate nested form on the fly, rather than loading both the schedule & event form on every page load and trying to show/hide them as necessary.If you can think of any other ideas, I am all ears. Thanks.[SOLVED] In addition to the above changes, I updated the project controller as follows, to always build a form for the missing child record type:This nested form is now working like a charm, both in the new and in the edit view.","['Take inspiration from https://www.stimulus-components.com/docs/stimulus-rails-nested-form/You need to build a nested form template for every relation.

Getting your back even tighter and doing a static start instead of a dynamic start can also help with this. You can do tempo snatches, pulls, or snatch deadlifts to help fix this. Making them halting (paused) for 3 seconds when the bar just leaves the floor will be an even blunter instrument.More overhead squats and snatch balances if you can do them, both with 3 second pauses at the bottom, keeping tight the entire time, to address overhead stability.', 'Thank you for the feedback.

See how your hips rise, causing you to hinge at the hip and kind of deadlift it up? One of the most important things I learnt while coaching oly lifting in a powerlifting gym is that the snatch and clean are not deadlifting movements, they’re squatting movements. So you want to keep your weight mid foot, keep your hips low and squeeze with your glutes to get the bar moving. That will keep the bar path much straighter coming off the floor. As you come up, keep leading up with your chest (take a deep breath before you lift to help you brace). The more you lead up with the chest, the closer the bar will stay to you. The flatter you are over the bar means your hips have to go so much further to connect with the bar and you lose all your power. Most importantly at the moment though, it’s about getting reps in.

Kind of like using a filter to add a task instead of search. This might be asking to much but I'm not very good at creating these things in ifttt. If this matters I'm hopping to have these perimeters add @work p1 today inboxThank you","['I did this using the dictionary on my keyboard app. You can set it up so that any set of characters, such as td_text, can be replaced by another string - like @work P1 #inbox today. Then when you use the todoist widget you would add your task text and then add td_text at the end and your keyboard will offer the full string as an auto correct text.', ""Thank you. This isn't exactly what I was looking for but it is still very helpful. I like how I can set up a few different input scenarios. I'll be using this. I was able to find something else that will be useful for quick adding through speach. I'm on Android and I created a webhook through ifttt and the app join. It allows you to create a widget that instantly pops up the microphone to listen for speach, then closes the microphone. Anything you said during the recording is instantly in your todoist app.  Nothing else to open, close or edit. But you still have to manually open todoist to add any of the quick add items or make any edits.  I'll be able to quickly edit them with your keyboard shortcut. Thanks again."", 'iOS has this....

And the process continues the more I read about this debate.The same happens with me about issue like gun violence in America, reservation (a controversial Indian issue. See [this] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India)for more information)The problem is that these debates are so saturated with good arguments or atleast arguments that sound good on both sides, so it's very difficult to form a concrete opinion on these things. It's very confusing.","['It seems you struggle with critical thinking. This is not meant to be an insult to you, this is a learned skill. Its good to be open to arguments and viewpoints from many sides. However, you apparently struggle with contextualizing arguments and the nuance of reality.To even oscillate between grandiose economic-ideological concepts like capitalism or socialism based on a redditors’ comment proves you don’t understand either very well. One who understands these concepts don’t just “support” an ideology like this.It is better to think of these concepts as fluid ways of life and every single modern state adopts aspects from both sides. N. Korea relies on capitalistic financing institutions and the US offers comprehensive social welfare which begins by garnishing every single workers’ wage at the paycheck. These ideologies are not “things” they are phenomena, the combination of an infinite range of policy to deal with political economics.', 'Being able to entertain opposing views simultaneously is a sign of intelligence.Being able to change your opinion about something is also a sign of intelligence.Now practice your intellectual skills to hone them, just like any other skill.', 'Capitalism with socialistic policies is the best model.', 'As you can see, the world struggles with these opinions as well. There are some good examples of each concept, fun violence in the UK is pretty low.The false premise is in speaking in absolutes about concepts, like ""socialism"". There\'s no example of absolute, almost anywhere you look. Everything is in the grey zone, kinda this with a little of that.  Maybe you can point to North Korea for a few absolutes but you will also notice the tradeoffs.None of the concepts are tangible things, they don\'t exist, like science does. They are just ideas and that\'s why they are so hard to pin down.', 'You\'re way ahead of most people in that you\'re recognizing the difficulty and complexity of the problem.  My advice to you is don\'t ever lose that -- that curiosity, that intellectual humility, that hunger for knowledge, that sense of ""beginner\'s mind"" (curious naivete).  It is one of the most valuable things in the world which has been the source of many great discoveries.The great political theorist Leo Strauss said political philosophy is the process of replacing opinion with knowledge.I can recommend David Miller, Political Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction as a starting point.', 'Learn as much as you can about the topic. Listen to what different people have to say about itBut make sure your facts are correct - go to the original source. Many pundits and media outlets may only present certain facts that support their position or misinterpret the factsDon’t be afraid to change your position or change your mind', 'I would say don\'t really on social media, Reddit, or even internet think pieces to form opinions as fundamental as ""is socialism or capitalism a better economic system.""I would say go to the original sources. On this topic, try to read The Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels and The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. They are not easy reading, but certainly comprehensible for most people.For specific public policy issues like gun control, look for an article that cites peer-reviewed academic sources, and then go look up those sources and read them for yourself', 'Markets work and create a non-arbitrary way to organize society. However, people that call themselves capitalists typically fetishize markets and ignore market failures. Most successful socialist countries use the government as a way for the people to collectively bargain as consumers. That is one important aspect of government. In the US one of our two parties hates the government being used in this way for things like healthcare. As a result, Americans pay more pet capita for insurance and not everyone is covered. That’s an example of a market failure. Another good example is the Tobacco companies misusing science in order to fool smokers into thinking the science about smoking causing illness was not “settled”. Markets are like the power of water. They can be tamed and made to work for people, or they can be fetishized and misused to the detriment of average people.']"

The season prior he put up 27.4 PPG on 50/42/85 splits with 63.4 TS%Also, the Bulls offence doesn’t support Zach enough. Zach is a rhythm player, but this season either when he gets hot he doesn’t get the ball enough because both DeMar or Vucevic start taking their turns on shots, or when he misses a few he doesn’t get the opportunity to shoot himself out of a slumpThe lack of plays run for him combined with give and go iso ball with DeMar is definitely affecting his game. Zach isn’t the strongest iso player anyways, we need a more flowing offence for him to be better and get him some easier shots.

How to conditionally-display nested forms with multiple children models in parent model edit view?,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/wswj32/how_to_conditionallydisplay_nested_forms_with/,"I have 3 models, nested as follows:The Project model has a project_type attribute, which can be set to schedule, event or list:When project_type is set to schedule, the user can create and associate one or more schedule children records with the project record.When project_type is set to event, the user can create and associate one or more event children records with the project record.When project_type is set to list, the user simply creates a project record, with no schedule or event records associated with it.In the project new view, this works perfectly fine: the user uses radio buttons to determine the value of project_type, and a nested form is displayed accordingly: one schedule form (with a button to add more), one event form (with a button to add more), or no form at all, per the logic introduced above.Here is how I implemented it, using Stimulus:Here is the top of the form:Here is the part of the form that is displayed conditionally for schedules, based on the selection of the user, above:And, here is its equivalent, for events:I use Turbo Frames to allow the user to add more schedule/event forms as necessary, by clicking an ""Add Schedule"" or ""Add Event"" button: I am omitting this part of the code here, as I do not believe it is necessary to solve this issue, but I can include it in an update if relevant.Finally, here is project_type_controller.js:Note*: please bear with me, I am aware the above code needs some serious DRYing up, but I will refactor once I get it working properly.*So, like I said, the above code works perfectly when the form is loaded in the project new view and a new project is created.However, when the form is loaded in the project edit view, i.e. when a user needs to edit an existing project:Then the user is able to access the nested form related to whichever child(ren) schedule/event record(s) is(are) associated with the parent project record, and it's even possible to add more forms, with the corresponding ""Add Schedule"" or ""Add Event"" button.BUT the logic to switch between project_types (schedule, event, list) with radio buttons no longer works: I am not able to display the appropriate nested form when toggling the radio buttons.It seems that the problem is that, whichever nested form was NOT selected upon create — let's the schedule form in the case of an event project —  is simply not included at all in the HTML in the edit view, and therefore it's not possible to set hidden to false to make it appear with the logic implemented in project_type_controller.js, as is possible in the new view (where both the schedule and the event nested forms are served by default).This shows up in the console as the following error:I am hitting a wall, as I have been unable to figure out how to ""force"" include both nested forms in the HTML regardless of the value of project_type, to be able to show or hide them based on how the user toggles the related radio buttons.Is this even a way to accomplish what I need with this approach or have I fallen into anti-pattern territory? If this is a dead end, what would be the best way to implement this business logic?[UPDATE] based on u/cmd-t's comments, I have updated the schedule form like this:And the event form like this:Finally, I have updated the project_type_controller like this:I got the above working in the project new view, and it seems cleaner that what I was running initially (although it still needs to be DRYed up), but I am back to square 1 when it comes to the project edit view:When the user opens the edit view, the right form is presented to them (i.e. the schedule form is the project is a schedule, the event form if the project is an event, and no form if the project is a list).However, as soon as the user changes the type of project by toggling the radio buttons, then we run into the same problem as before, which is that we cannot rend the form for the type of children records that were not saved with the parent project record upon create:If a project was created as a schedule, with one or more schedule children records, then <template data-project-type-target=""event_template""> is rendered as empty in the edit view.If a project was created as an event, with one or more event children records, then <template data-project-type-target=""schedule_template""> is rendered as empty in the edit view.If a project was created as a list, with no schedule or event children records, then both  <template data-project-type-target=""event_template""> and data-project-type-target=""schedule_template""> are rendered as empty in the edit view.In other words: the logic to display the templates is working as expected, but the code inside the templates isn't, which I suppose is happening due to how nested forms work within rails.One avenue I am exploring is to use Turbo Stream to generate and render the appropriate nested form on the fly, rather than loading both the schedule & event form on every page load and trying to show/hide them as necessary.If you can think of any other ideas, I am all ears. Thanks.[SOLVED] In addition to the above changes, I updated the project controller as follows, to always build a form for the missing child record type:This nested form is now working like a charm, both in the new and in the edit view.","['Take inspiration from https://www.stimulus-components.com/docs/stimulus-rails-nested-form/You need to build a nested form template for every relation. Then you can easily switch between them or render additional nested forms if needed.Template elements are ignored by the browser, but you can render any html into them.', 'That makes sense: I will give it a try. Thank you very much.', 'I have been able to wrap the schedule form and the event form into their respective templates, and as a result: both are hidden on page load. What I am struggling with is how to display the content of each template depending on what the selects in the radio buttons, with the toggle() function in my Stimulus controller. Most of the examples I find related to HTML templates (such as this one) mention cloning the innerHTML of the template and injecting it into the DOM, but that does not feel very Stimulus-y, if I may say — plus, I have not managed to make it work. Have you come across any resources explaining how to show the content of HTML templates with Stimulus?']"

I don’t usually have gut issues unless it’s after several antibiotics.

To me, this feels similar to self-inquiry practice in the Advaita Vedanta tradition where you try to rest in your own awareness, or the sense of ""I am"".

How long does a stricture take to form?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/wejg1x/how_long_does_a_stricture_take_to_form/,"Hi everyone,I just had a quick question about strictures. I was only diagnosed about a year and half ago. When first diagnosed I had pretty bad inflammation, CRP was in the 40's I believe. After a quick bout of prednisone combined with mesalamine I was what I believe in Remission (Labs looked good, etc.) over the last year and a half since diagnosis I have felt back and forth between having symptoms and not. I wouldn't say I have had a full blown flare since then, but follow-up labs did show slight inflammation still (CRP was good, but calprotectin was slightly elevated as of recent, 150 was the #).I started to worry about a stricture, but I also have a lot of anxiety around this disease, and health anxiety in general. I called my gastro and they went ahead and scheduled an MRI, as well as a small bowel. When the results came back it all looked good, but they did see what they believe was either some disease activity or small scar tissue from when I was first diagnosed, hard to say.It has been roughly a month or two since my MRI, but I still get anxious about a strictures/bowel obstructions.I guess my questions was, and hopefully to lay some anxiety to rest, how long does a stricture normally take to develop? Like I said I have no actively have extremely high inflammation levels, but my anxiety gets the best of me when I hear my body making slight digestion noises or feel a bit of pressure/dullness in my abdomen.Just as a side note, I recently started Humira as my first biologic, I still have a few symptoms such as loose stool sometimes, but that seems to be the extent of it. Starting my first maintenance dose on Thursday and hoping to clear up remaining inflammation!","[""I don't know for sure (not a doctor), but based on what my GI has said to me, it sounds like it takes a while. I have a stricture at my terminal ileum, which wasn't seen on my first scope in 2013. When I got my next scope with my new GI in 2017, he said he thought I probably had Crohn's for longer than the 4 years I'd had the diagnosis because of the stricture formation."", 'Okay, thanks for clearing that up. I would assume it would take a while, and I had no signs of Crohn’s until a year and a half ago, and since then all my labs have been decent beside some mild inflammation, but nothing major. I would assume it would take a while. I had a CT scan 2 months ago and they didn’t see anything.. so I guess my anxiety it getting the better of me making me think I’ve developed one in that amount of time lol.']"

Is there any workaround possible? I know I can migrate to Bitwarden, but I already got used to KeePassDX... Maybe it can do what I'm trying to get from Bitwarden?Thank you!","[""can't you just set keepass as default password manager?"", ""Well, KeePassDX is already set there as default and it works fine for login/pass credentials. What I want it to do is to fill in frequently used fields not related to a particular website (e.g. email, address, city, name, etc). In Bitwarden this is called Identity: you create one with all the fields you need and it plugs that data wherever it finds these fields.If KeePassDX does that too - will be the perfect solution for me, as I like it the most among many others I've tried.""]"

I would like to make friends with other gay men just so I can talk to others about gay stuff. I come from quite a small town so I have no idea how I can go about meeting other gay men or lesbian women in order to form friendships. Does anyone have any advice on how I can go about this?P.S. I know this is very sad but that's why I'm asking. I can't turn my life around when I don't know how.,"[""Thanks so much for this advice.
