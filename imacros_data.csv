*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=3331&sid=943751ee8efade66f5f48142072befdc,"['Post last updated: May 25, 2020.\n\nIf you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):\n\n1. What version of iMacros are you using?\nYou find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.\n\n2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)\nExample: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...\n\n3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)\nExample: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...\n\n4. Do the included demo macros work ok? \nThis test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.\n\n5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.\nThis test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.\n\n6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?\nIf you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?\n\n7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? \nNote: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.\n\n8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.\nThis includes a detailed description of the steps you\'ve tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!\n\nThis information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.\n\nAdditional tips when posting\n\n* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.\nFor example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.\n\n* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.\nAvoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.\n\n* Don\'t post the same question to more than one forum.\nIf you\'ve miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post\'s subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.\n\n* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.\nSome of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don\'t put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.\n\n* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.\nToo often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.\n\n* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings\n\nThank you for helping us to help you better!']"
How to enter a large amount of text into a text area field,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=18475&sid=943751ee8efade66f5f48142072befdc,"[""Simple!\n\nJust put all of the text into a CSV file.

Automating a tricky file upload dialog,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=12671&sid=943751ee8efade66f5f48142072befdc,"[""There are many cases where a web page presents a file input field for entering/selecting a file to upload.  In these cases, it is very easy to use a simple TAG command for the input field and specify the appropriate file in the CONTENT parameter, as shown in the Upload.iim demo macro that ships with iMacros.\n\nHowever, there are also cases where an input field is not provided on the web form (or it is not directly editable), and you can only choose the file by using a file upload dialog, which is usually presented after clicking a button or link.  There are even cases where automatic click-mode does not work for recording the click on the upload button, and you must use DirectScreen or IMAGECLICK to click the button, as in the following example.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is, once you are presented with the file upload dialog, how do you automate it to specify the file you want to upload?\n\nThe answer is: use the DS CMD=KEY command after the dialog appears to send the path/name of the file and press Enter.\n\nThe following macro demonstrates just how to do this for the example page shown above:\nCode: Select allVERSION BUILD=7221254\nTAB T=1\nTAB CLOSEALLOTHERS\nSIZE X=800 Y=867\nURL GOTO=http://kleinanzeigen.ebay.de/anzeigen/p-anzeige-aufgeben.html\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=A FORM=ID:pstctgry-frm ATTR=ID:cat_195\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=A FORM=ID:pstctgry-frm ATTR=ID:cat_275\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=BUTTON:SUBMIT FORM=ID:pstctgry-frm ATTR=TXT:Weiter\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:RADIO FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:adType1&&VALUE:OFFER CONTENT=YES\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:RADIO FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:posterType1&&VALUE:PRIVATE CONTENT=YES\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:postad-title CONTENT=Italien<SP>-<SP>Ferienwohnung<SP>mit<SP>Garten<SP>-<SP>4<SP>Personen<SP>max.\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:pstad-price CONTENT=290\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:pstad-zip CONTENT=80331\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=ID:adFormBottom ATTR=ID:pstad-descrptn CONTENT=blah<SP>blah<SP>blah\n\n' Click the file upload button\nDS CMD=CLICK X=320 Y=517\n\n' Wait a second to give the dialog a chance to pop up\nWAIT SECONDS=1\n\n' Send the path/name of the file and Enter to the dialog\nDS CMD=KEY CONTENT=C:\\Temp\\Current.png{ENTER}\n\nNote: This method will only work if the upload dialog does not block further execution of the macro. For example, if the file upload dialog is invoked by a Flash, Java, or Silverlight application, the macro may not be able to continue once the dialog appears and remains stuck. In this case, depending on how the file upload is implemented by the site / web application, you might be able to work around the issue by e.g. disabling Flash as described in this post.\n\nSee also: this post that describes a scenario where using a normal TAG command to upload the file may work by adding the CONTENT parameter to the command that clicks the Browse (or similarly named) button on the page for selecting the file.""]"

CSV Standard File Format,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=307&sid=943751ee8efade66f5f48142072befdc,"['The CSV (""Comma Separated Values"") file format is often used to exchange data between differently similar applications. The CSV file format is useable by Internet Macros, Microsoft Excel and many other applications. \n\nThe CSV Format:\n\n1. Each record is one line - Line separator may be LF (0x0A) or CRLF (0x0D0A), a line seperator may also be embedded in the data (making a record more than one line but still acceptable). \n\n2. Fields are separated with commas. \n\n3. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored - Unless the field is delimited with double-quotes in that case the whitespace is preserved. \n\n4. Embedded commas - Field must be delimited with double-quotes. \n\n5. Embedded double-quotes - Embedded double-quote characters must be doubled, and the field must be delimited with double-quotes. \n\n6. Embedded line-breaks - Fields must be surounded by double-quotes. \n\n7. Always Delimiting - Fields may always be delimited with double quotes, the delimiters will be parsed and discarded by the reading applications. \n\nHere are some examples that demonstrate the rules above.

If more then three pieces of user input are needed you simply run out of variables. The solution is to take the user input step by step. \n\nFirst, let the macro navigate to the site where the input is needed. Then use the PROMPT command to ask for the first three inputs and fill the webform with these three pieces of information using the TAG command. \n\nNow the variables are free to be used with the PROMPT command again since the input has already been given to the website.

How to run the same macro on different domains?,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2514&sid=943751ee8efade66f5f48142072befdc,"['Question: \nLets say there are 2 or more different domains having the same \nwebform or webpage,\n\nDomain1.com/page.html  =  Domain2.com/page.html  =  Domain3.com/page.html The 3 webpages above are similar and have the \nsame details to be filled in, just clicking here and there selecting \nsome options, but they are on different domains. Is your macro able \nto fill them using the same script?\n\nAnswer:\n(1) If the web pages are very similar and the only difference is a different domain, then the macro will run without changes on all domains. You only need to remove the URL GOTO=.... command manually. This command was inserted during macro recording. After this is done, then you manually go to one of the domains and start the macro.\n\n(2) Alternatively, if there are differences between the forms, for example different link names or input boxes, you can still create one macro that works for all websites: \n\n(2a) Use the wildcard * to make the TAG command fit for all your domains\n\nExample: On domain1.com/page.htm  you get\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:newsletterform ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\nOn domain2.com/page.htm  you get\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:news  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\n=> Create this TAG command\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:*news*  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\n\n(2b) Assume, on domain3.com/page.htm  you have\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:subscribe  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\nThen you can use two lines and add the ""ERRORIGNORE"" command:\nSET !ERRORIGNORE YES\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:*news*  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:subscribe  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\n=> iMacros will use the line that works and ignores the other.', ""So I've created a macro that will run on different domains.  The only problem I've encountered is that when the text boxes have asterisks by them, it doesn't output my information.\n\nFor example, a website will have a field but instead of naming it URL, the field is named *URL, (The * denoting that the field is required) and my macro doesn't work.\n\nHere is my code:\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT ATTR=ID:*url* CONTENT=http://www.website.com\n\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated."", ""I am on Firefox and need to put my phone number on certain places in different forms.

With DirectScreen clicks we can force them to open, but since our goal is ""only"" to reserve a car (= web automation, not testing the calendar control), we decide to fill in the fields directly.\n\nHow to edit the macro:\n1.

To test this, simply log in as this user and test run the iMacros browser. See also http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?t=1439 for more iimRunner hints.']"

How to loop from 1-20 or Higher,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1014&sid=943751ee8efade66f5f48142072befdc,"[""I've been trying to get IM to loop through images stored on a website which are numbered. For example numbered 1-20. Obviously the following simple macro will do the job\n\nVERSION BUILD=304809 \nTAB T=1     \nTAB CLOSEALLOTHERS  \nONDOWNLOAD SET !ERRORCONTINUE YES\nSET !VAR1 http://www.website.com/images/\nURL GOTO={{!VAR1}}{{!LOOP}}.jpg   \n\nThen run the loop. The problem is that the images are numbered with leading zeroes e.g. 01, 02, ... 09, 10, 11 etc.\n\nSo if I run the loop as above it skips the first nine images as it attempts to find images 1.jpg rather than 01.jpg etc.\n\nI can easily get round that by amending the fourth line to read\n\nSET !VAR1 http://www.website.com/images/0\n\nBut then it won't access images ten or above as it now tries to read them as 010.jpg rather than 10.jpg.\n\nCurrently the only way I can see to solve this is by running the macro twice, once for images 1-9 and once for images 10+. Is there any way to solve this in just a single macro?\n\nIncidentally I did experiment with using the following block\n\nSET !VAR1 http://www.website.com/images/0\nURL GOTO={{!VAR1}}{{!LOOP}}.jpg   \nSET !VAR2 http://www.website.com/images/\nURL GOTO={{!VAR2}}{{!LOOP}}.jpg   \n\nThis works but its painfully slow as ever loop it accesses a non-existant page."", 'Hi,\n\nI do not see any way to do this in the macro language because this would require some if..then..else construct, which is not possible in iMacros macro language.\n\nThe only way I see is to use a batch file or script to do the logic and pass the right value to the macro. This requires, however, the PRO or Scripting Edition.\n\nRegards\n---\nLasse Clausen, iOpus Support']"
