*** Please read this before reporting problems ***,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=3331&sid=cce5cad11886b5e8da078b59befd40f8,"['Post last updated: May 25, 2020.\n\nIf you open a new topic (or post for the first time in some existing topic) to report an issue or ask any question, we can respond much faster if your problem description includes the following information (if applicable, not all questions fit to all problems):\n\n1. What version of iMacros are you using?\nYou find the iMacros version and build information at the top of every macro that you record, for example ""VERSION BUILD=10100795"". Also specify whether you are using a freeware, trial, or licensed version, e.g. Personal Edition. Please test with the latest version.\n\n2. What operating system are you using? (please also specify language)\nExample: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012R2, English, German, Chinese, ...\n\n3. Which browser(s) are you using? (include version numbers)\nExample: Chrome 74.0.3729.13, Firefox 64.0.2, IE 11/10/9, ...\n\n4. Do the included demo macros work ok? \nThis test helps us to determine if the problem is a general iMacros issue or is somehow related to a specific website or configuration.\n\n5. If reporting a problem with the iMacros scripting interface, please also test if the included VBS sample scripts run ok.\nThis test helps us to determine if the iMacros scripting interface installation is ok.\n\n6. If recording or replay fails on a specific website: Can you please post the URL of the web page and/or the macro that creates the problem?\nIf you cannot post the macro in a public user forum or the website requires a login, can you provide a similar example of the problem on a publicly accessible website?\n\n7. Do you encounter the same problem recording or replaying the macro in different browsers, such as the iMacros browser, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer? \nNote: If the problem is specific to Firefox or Chrome, please post in either the iMacros for Firefox or iMacros for Chrome sub-forum respectively.\n\n8. Please include any additional information that is relevant to reproducing the issue.\nThis includes a detailed description of the steps you\'ve tried as well as the specific error codes and messages, macro logs, screen shots, etc. Please upload screenshots and other relevant files directly to the forum and not to a third-party hosting service!\n\nThis information allows us to quickly re-create the issue on our test systems and solve it ASAP.\n\nAdditional tips when posting\n\n* Please ensure that the content of your post is relevant to the topic and/or forum where you post it.\nFor example, if you are having a problem extracting data from a web page and are using Firefox, create your post in the Data Extraction and Web Screen Scraping forum rather than the iMacros for Firefox forum (see note #7 above). If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.\n\n* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.\nAvoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.\n\n* Don\'t post the same question to more than one forum.\nIf you\'ve miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post\'s subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.\n\n* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.\nSome of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don\'t put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts. Include the information directly in the body of the post instead.\n\n* When sharing screenshots or other relevant files, please upload them directly to the forum rather than use a third-party hosting/sharing service.\nToo often these services stop functioning or the files become unavailable for whatever reason. Uploading them here ensures that the full context of the post remains consistent over time.\n\n* Take a minute to review your forum notification settings\n\nThank you for helping us to help you better!']"
How to enter a large amount of text into a text area field,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=18475&sid=cce5cad11886b5e8da078b59befd40f8,"[""Simple!\n\nJust put all of the text into a CSV file.

Automating a tricky file upload dialog,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=12671&sid=cce5cad11886b5e8da078b59befd40f8,"[""There are many cases where a web page presents a file input field for entering/selecting a file to upload.  In these cases, it is very easy to use a simple TAG command for the input field and specify the appropriate file in the CONTENT parameter, as shown in the Upload.iim demo macro that ships with iMacros.\n\nHowever, there are also cases where an input field is not provided on the web form (or it is not directly editable), and you can only choose the file by using a file upload dialog, which is usually presented after clicking a button or link.  There are even cases where automatic click-mode does not work for recording the click on the upload button, and you must use DirectScreen or IMAGECLICK to click the button, as in the following example.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is, once you are presented with the file upload dialog, how do you automate it to specify the file you want to upload?\n\nThe answer is: use the DS CMD=KEY command after the dialog appears to send the path/name of the file and press Enter.\n\nThe following macro demonstrates just how to do this for the example page shown above:\nCode: Select allVERSION BUILD=7221254\nTAB T=1\nTAB CLOSEALLOTHERS\nSIZE X=800 Y=867\nURL GOTO=http://kleinanzeigen.ebay.de/anzeigen/p-anzeige-aufgeben.html\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=A FORM=ID:pstctgry-frm ATTR=ID:cat_195\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=A FORM=ID:pstctgry-frm ATTR=ID:cat_275\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=BUTTON:SUBMIT FORM=ID:pstctgry-frm ATTR=TXT:Weiter\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:RADIO FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:adType1&&VALUE:OFFER CONTENT=YES\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:RADIO FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:posterType1&&VALUE:PRIVATE CONTENT=YES\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:postad-title CONTENT=Italien<SP>-<SP>Ferienwohnung<SP>mit<SP>Garten<SP>-<SP>4<SP>Personen<SP>max.\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:pstad-price CONTENT=290\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=ID:adForm ATTR=ID:pstad-zip CONTENT=80331\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=ID:adFormBottom ATTR=ID:pstad-descrptn CONTENT=blah<SP>blah<SP>blah\n\n' Click the file upload button\nDS CMD=CLICK X=320 Y=517\n\n' Wait a second to give the dialog a chance to pop up\nWAIT SECONDS=1\n\n' Send the path/name of the file and Enter to the dialog\nDS CMD=KEY CONTENT=C:\\Temp\\Current.png{ENTER}\n\nNote: This method will only work if the upload dialog does not block further execution of the macro. For example, if the file upload dialog is invoked by a Flash, Java, or Silverlight application, the macro may not be able to continue once the dialog appears and remains stuck. In this case, depending on how the file upload is implemented by the site / web application, you might be able to work around the issue by e.g. disabling Flash as described in this post.\n\nSee also: this post that describes a scenario where using a normal TAG command to upload the file may work by adding the CONTENT parameter to the command that clicks the Browse (or similarly named) button on the page for selecting the file.""]"

The CSV file format is useable by Internet Macros, Microsoft Excel and many other applications. \n\nThe CSV Format:\n\n1. Each record is one line - Line separator may be LF (0x0A) or CRLF (0x0D0A), a line seperator may also be embedded in the data (making a record more than one line but still acceptable). \n\n2. Fields are separated with commas. \n\n3. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored - Unless the field is delimited with double-quotes in that case the whitespace is preserved. \n\n4. Embedded commas - Field must be delimited with double-quotes. \n\n5. Embedded double-quotes - Embedded double-quote characters must be doubled, and the field must be delimited with double-quotes. \n\n6. Embedded line-breaks - Fields must be surounded by double-quotes. \n\n7. Always Delimiting - Fields may always be delimited with double quotes, the delimiters will be parsed and discarded by the reading applications. \n\nHere are some examples that demonstrate the rules above.

Need more than 3 variables,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2858&sid=cce5cad11886b5e8da078b59befd40f8,"['Q: I use the PROMPT command in my macro for user input.

If more then three pieces of user input are needed you simply run out of variables. The solution is to take the user input step by step. \n\nFirst, let the macro navigate to the site where the input is needed. Then use the PROMPT command to ask for the first three inputs and fill the webform with these three pieces of information using the TAG command. \n\nNow the variables are free to be used with the PROMPT command again since the input has already been given to the website.

How to run the same macro on different domains?,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2514&sid=cce5cad11886b5e8da078b59befd40f8,"['Question: \nLets say there are 2 or more different domains having the same \nwebform or webpage,\n\nDomain1.com/page.html  =  Domain2.com/page.html  =  Domain3.com/page.html The 3 webpages above are similar and have the \nsame details to be filled in, just clicking here and there selecting \nsome options, but they are on different domains. Is your macro able \nto fill them using the same script?\n\nAnswer:\n(1) If the web pages are very similar and the only difference is a different domain, then the macro will run without changes on all domains. You only need to remove the URL GOTO=.... command manually. This command was inserted during macro recording. After this is done, then you manually go to one of the domains and start the macro.\n\n(2) Alternatively, if there are differences between the forms, for example different link names or input boxes, you can still create one macro that works for all websites: \n\n(2a) Use the wildcard * to make the TAG command fit for all your domains\n\nExample: On domain1.com/page.htm  you get\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:newsletterform ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\nOn domain2.com/page.htm  you get\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:news  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\n=> Create this TAG command\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:*news*  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\n\n(2b) Assume, on domain3.com/page.htm  you have\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:subscribe  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\nThen you can use two lines and add the ""ERRORIGNORE"" command:\nSET !ERRORIGNORE YES\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:*news*  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:subscribe  ATTR=NAME:Email CONTENT=test@test.com\n\n=> iMacros will use the line that works and ignores the other.', ""So I've created a macro that will run on different domains.  The only problem I've encountered is that when the text boxes have asterisks by them, it doesn't output my information.\n\nFor example, a website will have a field but instead of naming it URL, the field is named *URL, (The * denoting that the field is required) and my macro doesn't work.\n\nHere is my code:\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT ATTR=ID:*url* CONTENT=http://www.website.com\n\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated."", ""I am on Firefox and need to put my phone number on certain places in different forms.

With DirectScreen clicks we can force them to open, but since our goal is ""only"" to reserve a car (= web automation, not testing the calendar control), we decide to fill in the fields directly.\n\nHow to edit the macro:\n1.

Extracting Nested Tables,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=15565&sid=37c7b6005e7216c702d63986787e8524,"['Hello everyone,\n\nAs many of you are aware, the table extraction format changed from iMacros 6 to iMacros 7. As a result, iMacros 7 no longer formats table data with the #NEXT# and #NEWLINE# delimiters when extracting a table containing nested tables - a normal text extraction is performed instead.\n\n[Update: iMacros 8 now includes #NEXT# and #NEWLINE# delimiters when extracting nested tables.]\n\nOne workaround to this is to only extract the innermost table. However, there are many cases where you may need to extract the entire table including all sub-tables, while retaining the format of V6. This is especially important if you have many legacy macros and scripts that depend on this format.\n\nThe following VBScript routines will accomplish this for you!\n\nThis solution requires the iMacros Scripting Edition, and it also requires you to use EXTRACT=HTM when extracting your table instead of EXTRACT=TXT.\n\nOnce you have extracted the table HTML and retrieved it with a call to iimGetLastExtract, you simply pass it to ExtractTableV6 and it returns the data in a format similar to that used in V6.\nCode: Select allFunction ExtractTableV6(htmlTable)\n\' Extracts a table (including nested tables) from raw HTML extracted with iMacros\n\' using the TYPE=TABLE and EXTRACT=HTM parameters. \n\n\tDim doc\n\tSet doc = CreateObject(""HTMLFile"")\n\tdoc.write htmlTable\n\t\n\tDim outermostTable, tableData\n\tSet outermostTable = doc.getElementsByTagName(""TABLE"")(0)\n\t\n\tExtractTableV6 = ExtractChildNodesV6(outermostTable, tableData, False)\n\nEnd Function\n\nFunction ExtractChildNodesV6(ByRef node, ByRef tableData, ByVal isNestedTable)\n\' Recursive function to extract all child nodes of the given outermost TABLE node.\n\' The returned data contains #NEXT# and #NEWLINE# delimiters for each table cell and \n\' row in a format similar to iMacros 6.\n\n\tDim child, text\n\t\n\tFor Each child In node.children\n\t\tIf child.tagName = ""P"" Then\n\t\t\ttableData = tableData & vbNewLine\n\t\tEnd If\n\n\t\tIf child.children.length = 0 Then\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIf child.tagName = ""BR"" Then\n\t\t\t\ttext = vbNewLine\n\t\t\tElse\n\t\t\t\tIf Len(tableData) > 1 And Right(tableData, 2) <> vbNewLine  Then\n\t\t\t\t\ttext = "" ""\n\t\t\t\tElse\n\t\t\t\t\ttext = """"\n\t\t\t\tEnd If\n\t\t\t\ttext = text & child.innerText\n\t\t\tEnd If\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ttableData = tableData & text\n\n\t\tElseIf child.children.length > 0 Then\n\t\t\tDim afterBegin : afterBegin = child.getAdjacentText(""afterBegin"")\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIf Len(afterBegin) > 0 Then\n\t\t\t\ttableData = tableData & child.getAdjacentText(""afterBegin"")\n\t\t\tEnd If\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIf child.tagName = ""TABLE"" Then\n\t\t\t\tisNestedTable = True\n\t\t\tEnd If\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ttableData = ExtractChildNodesV6(child, tableData, isNestedTable)\n\t\t\ttableData = tableData & child.getAdjacentText(""beforeEnd"")\n\t\tEnd If\n\n\t\tIf child.tagName = ""TD"" Or child.tagName = ""TH"" Then\n\t\t\ttableData = tableData & ""#NEXT#""\n\t\tElseIf child.tagName = ""TR"" Then\t\n\t\t\ttableData = tableData & ""#NEWLINE#""\n\t\t\tIf isNestedTable Then\n\t\t\t\ttableData = tableData & vbNewLine\n\t\t\tEnd If\n\t\tEnd If\n\tNext\n\t\n\tExtractChildNodesV6 = tableData\n\nEnd Function\n\nNote: The format may not be 100% identical to V6 with regards to spacing and end-of-line characters, however, the placement of the #NEXT# and #NEWLINE# markers for delimiting table cells and rows should be equivalent to V6. This code is not guaranteed to work with all tables, and it has only been tested with a limited set of test data.\n\nThis code is provided AS-IS, please feel free to update and modify it to suit your own specific needs!\n\nAttached is a complete example script that replicates the behavior and output of iMacros 6 for the following macro:\nCode: Select allURL GOTO=http://www.iopus.com/imacros/demo/v6/extract2/\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=P ATTR=CLASS:heading EXTRACT=TXT\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=BLOCKQUOTE ATTR=CLASS:bdytxt EXTRACT=TXT\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=TXT:This<SP>line<SP>is<SP>extracted* EXTRACT=TXT\nSAVEAS TYPE=EXTRACT FOLDER=* FILE=TestExtract_{{!NOW:hhmmss}}.csv\n']"

Therefore, it is no longer possible to tag an element relative to its outer element in a nested situation.\n\nThis is easier to understand with a simple example. The following macro first tags the table cell TD and looks for the next occurrence of a link.\nCode: Select allURL GOTO=http://www.iopus.com/imacros/demo/v6/extract2/\nTAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:bdytxt&&TXT:HREF<SP>extracts<SP>links\nTAG POS=R1 TYPE=A ATTR=TITLE:* EXTRACT=TXT\n\nWhile v6 extracts the link which is inside that table cell, namely ""HREF extracts links"", v7 and iMacros for Firefox extract the next  link\'s text: ""keyword detection with EXTRACT"". \n\nKnowing that relative positioning is relative to the element\'s end, all you have to do is change the anchor (reference) tag.

We use this site for demonstrational purposes, only.)\n\nHere\'s how the site and the table do look like:\n\n\n\nTechnique 1: By position only:\n\nAs HTML table fields are enclosed by <td> tags, we can use is in the extraction. Here\'s the code that extracts the first field (""Last Trade"") using the table\'s heading as an extraction anchor\nCode: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=B ATTR=TXT:ACME<SP>UNITED<SP>CP   \nTAG POS=R3 TYPE=TD ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT  \n\nPlaying with the parameters in the extraction wizard, we find that POS=R4 extracts the next field (first line, second column)\n\n\n\nand POS=R5 extracts the first entry of the second line.\n\nThus, extracting the whole table simply means to loop through the position values (starting with POS=R3). The odd values extracting the left column\'s data, while the even values identify the second column.\n\n======\n\nTechnique 2: By special formatting\nWhen using the Extraction Wizard on the first element of the first column (""Last Trade""), \n\n\n\nthe extraction command looks like this:\nCode: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:yfnc_tablehead1&&TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT \n\nAnd playing with the POS values in the Wizard shows that simply looping through the POS values (POS=1, POS=2,...) extracts all items of the first column.\n\nFor the second column, it is \nCode: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=TD ATTR=CLASS:yfnc_tabledata1&&TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT  \n\nthat does extract all fields (when looping through the POS values).\n\n(Note that the extraction might need to be manipulated in a script to yield valid CSV,)\n\n=======\n[Edit: updated this section on 2008/09/26]\n\nTechnique 3: By extracting whole lines or the whole table at once:\n\nAs HTML uses the <tr> tag to enclose a table\'s lines, we can also use these to extract the table\'s data. Using the Wizard (and relative extraction, again), we click on the table\'s heading, and then replace the type TR and the ATTRibute by ""TXT:*"". \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen saving this extraction, the macro looks like this:\nCode: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=H1 ATTR=TXT:ACME<SP>UNITED<SP>CP   \nTAG POS=R1 TYPE=TR ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT  \n\n\nAnd all following POS values (POS=2, POS=3, ...) do indeed extract the following lines.\n\nThe same can be done by using TABLE as the extraction tag\'s TYPE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich produces the following macro commands:\nCode: Select allTAG POS=1 TYPE=H1 ATTR=TXT:ACME<SP>UNITED<SP>CP   \nTAG POS=1 TYPE=TABLE ATTR=TXT:* EXTRACT=TXT  \n\n(Note that the extraction might need to be manipulated in a script to yield valid CSV,)', 'iMacro for Firefox does not include Extraction Wizard?\n\nDharmendra Uteshiya', 'dharmendra2000 wrote:iMacro for Firefox does not include Extraction Wizard?\n\nYes, but you can ""create"" extract commands by recording the TAG (by clicking the site\'s element) and manually adding ""EXTRACT=TXT"" (or the like) to the recorded TAG command.\n\nCf. http://wiki.imacros.net/TAG#The_EXTRACT_Parameter']"

If you are unsure which forum to post to, use the General Support & Discussions forum.\n\n* Use a topic title that succinctly describes the problem or issue.\nAvoid phrases such as ""Please Help"", ""Urgent"", ""Script not working"", etc. and refrain from using all capital letters and exclamation points. Also, double-check that the spelling of the title and body of the post are correct, since this makes it more likely to be found in searches by other users. Most modern browsers automatically check spelling as you type and underline mistakes, so please correct them before submitting your post.\n\n* Don\'t post the same question to more than one forum.\nIf you\'ve miscategorized your original post, just click the Exclamation Icon on the right of the post\'s subject/title line to report it and let us know where you would like it moved or merged.\n\n* Always provide your FCI (Full Config Info), c.f. items 1-3 above, in your original post even if you think it may not be relevant.\nSome of our mods may not even respond unless this information is included. Please don\'t put this information in your signature, because this can change over time and makes it more confusing when reviewing older posts.

Handling web browser crashes,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1418&sid=ce0ce7e79c1b39c38058cf7dba47fee7,"['Sometimes a website can crash a web browser. This can happen to Firefox, Internet Explorer and (unfortunately) even the iMacros web browser. Often, such a crash is caused not by the browser itself but by a third-party plugin such as Flash or Java. From a web automation point of view, the crash itself is often not a big problem if the controlling program/script itself continues to run and reports the crash just like any other error. This is no problem when with the iMacros software:\n\nRun time error example:\n\n\nThe Scripting Interface will catch all kind of runtime errors (""crashes"") of the iMacros Browser or of Internet Explorer with iMacros plugin. It reports the crash back to the controlling program/script as negative error return code between -1 and -100. All the scripts needs to do is to call iimExit (to make sure the browser instance is really closed and not just frozen) and start a new instance with iimInit.\n\nIn VBS that looks like:\nCode: Select all    iret = iim1.iimPlay(""MyMacro"", 90) \n    if iret < 0 and iret > - 100 then\n       iret = iim1.iimExit ()\n       iret = iim1.iimInit ("""", TRUE)\n    end if\n\n\nIn this example we used 90 seconds as timeout value. If the Scripting Interface gets no reaction from the browser after 90 seconds it returns from the iimPlay command.\n\nNote: Not all error values between -1 and -100 are used, but this is the range that is reserverd for Interface related return codes. All error codes below -100 are macro related. All detailed list of error codes is available at http://www.iopus.com/imacros/help/scrip ... r_code.htm', ""This isn't a guarentee that a browser won't crash, is it?

Tips for using iimRunner,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1439&sid=ce0ce7e79c1b39c38058cf7dba47fee7,"['This article offers some advanced information for users of the Scripting Interface:\n\niimRunner allows you to run iMacros very easily under a Windows account that is different from the one that your calling code runs. This methods offers several advantages.\n\nThis feature is especially useful when calling iMacros from services, ASP, ASP.NET, PHP, ColdFusion, etc. because these kind of programs run typically under a rather restricted user account. \n\nWhen you move an application created with iimRunner to a new machine, it is important to make sure that you run iMacros at least once under its iimRunner account, just to make sure you clicked ""OK"" to all these popups that appear (only) the first time a web browser is started.\n\nA typical symptom if you forget this is a -322 (timeout) or -110 (macro not found) error. For the most likely cause of the -110 error see http://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?p=4212 (issue #4)\n\n\n\n\nIf using Windows 2003/2008, make sure that you add the URLs to the IE Enhanced Security configuration or remove this tool. The IE Enhanced Security configuration can be removed under Control Panel > Add/Remove Software > Windows Components', 'To start iimRunner, you can use the Windows task scheduler as shown in http://www.iopus.com/guides/winscheduler.htm\n\n\n\nInstead of imacros.exe you need to start iimRunner.exe\n\n\n\nSet iimRunner to start as soon as the PC starts. iMacros will under the same account as iimRunner, regardless under which account or under which programming or scripting language the iimInit (""-runner"") command is called.', 'About Windows Logon Types:\n\nIf you start iMacros or iimRunner form the task scheduler then iMacros starts in the Windows Logon type ""Batch mode"". This is easy to setup and sufficient for many macros, that do standard form filling and do not trigger dialog boxes.\n\nHowever, all web browsers (iMacros Browser, IE, Firefox...) and the plugins they use (Flash, PDF, Silverlight,...) are not designed to run in batch mode. They are only tested to work correctly under an interactive user session. And we found that indeed all browsers show ""strange"" behavior when run in batch mode. Examples of such problems are that some dialog boxes do not display correctly, SAVEAS dialogs might not work, or Flash and PDF addons do not function correctly. You can get problems that are very tricky to debug. \n\nIf you encounter such issues, the best way to run iMacros/iimRunner is to start it in an interactive or RemoteInteractive session. Such a session can be established automatically on a Windows Server, so that the interactive session with iimRunner starts with a server reboot. Therefore, using an interactive session has only advantages, except that it is a bit more tricky to setup. Our tech support has a step by step guide and a demo server available.']"

WSH Command Line Arguments,https://forum.imacros.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=438&sid=ce0ce7e79c1b39c38058cf7dba47fee7,"['A Windows Script Host (WSH) script can use command line arguments. These can be useful when you wish to pass some information into a script. The test.vbs example below is used at the command line by entering something like either of the following: \n\ncscript test.vbs a b c\nwscript test.vbs a b c \n\nThere are very few differences between cscript and wscript. Cscript is a console-based application and runs inside an MS-DOS box. The first command uses cscript to run test.vbs with a, b, and c as the command line parameters (arguments). The second command uses wscript to run test.vbs and has a, b, c as the command line parameters. \n\nTo get the command line parameters inside the VBS file please use:\nCode: Select allset args = WScript.Arguments\nnum = args.Count\n\nif num = 0 then\n   WScript.Echo ""No command line parameters!""\n   WScript.Quit 1\nend if\n\nfor k = 0 to num - 1\n   msgbox args.Item(k)\nnext\nWScript.Arguments is the collection containing the information on the arguments. Like all collections it has a Count property and an Item property, both of which are used above. Note how the Count is checked to see if it is zero. If so, we display an error message and quit the program. Item is an array of strings, and Item(k) gives a string containing the value supplied by the user as argument k.']"
